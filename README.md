## Protect the President

Protect the President is a game developed in Godot, inspired by the ancient board game Hnefatafl. In this game, the traditional Hnefatafl setup is reimagined where the king is replaced by a president, selectable from a range of US presidential skins past and present. The defenders take the role of presidential bodyguards, while the attackers portray protestors. The objective for the defenders is to safely escort the president to one or more escape areas on street-level layouts, while the attackers aim to surround and capture the president.
Gameplay Overview

    Objective: The defenders must guide the president to one of the designated escape areas on the street-level board layout. The attackers must surround and capture the president before reaching the escape areas.

    Board Layout: The game takes place on various street-level layouts, which may include obstacles and strategic positions affecting movement and tactics.

    Player Roles:
        Defenders: Control presidential bodyguards. Their goal is to ensure the safe passage of the president to the escape areas.
        Attackers: Control protestors. They aim to capture the president by surrounding them with their pieces.

    Movement: Similar to Hnefatafl, pieces (bodyguards and protestors) move orthogonally (not diagonally) across the board. Bodyguards move to protect and escort the president, while protestors move to surround and capture the president.

    Victory Conditions:
        Defenders Win: Successfully escort the president to one of the escape areas.
        Attackers Win: Surround and capture the president before reaching safety.
